# AI/ML-projects

Welcome to my **AI-ML Projects Repository**!  
This repository contains my learning and implementation work in the fields of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** using **Python**.

The purpose of this repository is to practice core concepts, build mini-projects, and upload implementations of different algorithms and NLP-based programs as I continue improving my skills.
